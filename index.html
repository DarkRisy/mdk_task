                    <h2>William Afton</h2>
                    <p>Springtrap is an early model of a Bonnie suit .
                        He is a heavily damaged rabbit animatronic of a dirty olive drab color. A great portion of his
                        right ear is missing with wires sticking out of the stump left behind. Springtrap's entire body
                        is torn and tattered with gaping holes exposing caging and wires throughout, thus making
                        Springtrap appear much more macabre-looking than any of the other animatronics from previous
                        installments. While both hands and feet are attached and generally intact, his legs are entirely
                        stripped from the mid-shin down, fully exposing endoskeleton metal and wiring. From his right
                        hand, half of the middle finger is missing. Both of Springtrap's eyes are properly set inside
                        his head and appear to be a pale gray.</p>

                    <h1>Spring Bonnie</h1>
                    <h2>William Afton</h2>
                    <p>Springy Bonnie has never been shown in full, appearing only in mini-games. Based on them, the
                        Spring Boney is a whole version of the Springtrap. Its body is golden in color, its belly is
                        colored lighter than the main body. He also had a decorative button on his body and a purple bow
                        tie. There are five fingers on his palms, which is associated with the ability to wear it as a
                        suit. He had white lenses, and the color of his eyes remains unknown. There is also a lever on
                        the body that allows you to switch the animatronic mode of the costume. His endoskeleton has the
                        ability to move apart to fit a person there.</p>

                    <h2>William Afton</h2>
                    <p>This animatronic is a damaged Springtrap that survived the fire at the Phasebear Horror
                        attraction caused by a security guard.
                        However, when Afton finally takes on a new form, his longtime friend and colleague Henry Emily,
                        who founded the franchise with William Afton, unleashes a certain call that three robots eager
                        to kill must respond to: The Destroyed Baby, Scraptrap and the Fused Freddy. Despite the fact
                        that each of the possessed robots decides to follow the deceptive call, William Afton turned out
                        to be smarter than the others and immediately suspected a trick, but still decided to respond
                        out of interest.</p>
